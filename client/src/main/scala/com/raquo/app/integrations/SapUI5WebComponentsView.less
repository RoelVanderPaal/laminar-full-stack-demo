  // Custom styles for web components.
  // These are some simple cases, and work fine, but because of shadow DOM isolation,
  // it's hard to style the insides of Web Components in a way that their author does not allow.

  // Here we override a CSS variable that is used by the UI5 Title component
  // to set title text color. Css properties are inherited from parent elements, so even though
  // we're setting this var on our own div, it will propagate down to the web components as well.

  // BEGIN[ui5-title]
  --sapGroup_TitleTextColor: #663300;
  // END[ui5-title]

  // The entire list of UI5 theming parameters is here:
  // https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents-react/blob/main/packages/base/src/styling/ThemingParameters.ts
  // However, instead of guessing which one of them you need in a particular case, just render your
  // web component, and then use the browser's style inspector to figure out which CSS var you need
  // to set. For example, if you select a `<ui-title>` element, you will see that its `color` CSS property
  // is set to `var(--sapGroup_TitleTextColor)` â€“ that's how we know that we need to set this var
  // to change the color.
  // UI5 developers promised to create a publicly available visual tool to help theme your apps,
  // but we don't have one yet. Currently they only offer such a tool to SAP customers.

  // For more detailed explanation of styling web components, and various options
  // to achieve it, see https://css-tricks.com/styling-a-web-component/
